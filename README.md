# concert-tracker
A web-based PHP solution to tracking concerts you've attended and artist you want to see.

Allows for simple management of artists and concerts, along with the ability to import and export data.

# Dependencies
* A web server with PHP support
* PostgreSQL or MySQL (Others may work, these are the only ones tested)

# Installation
The recommended installation is fairly straightforward:

1. Create a database role and a database that that role has full access to.
2. Extract the source to the web server, and point a virtual host to the concert-tracker root.
3. Navigate to the system in a web browser, and run the installation script using the database info from earlier.

At this point, the system should be fully operational.
